        <summary>How often should I service my motorcycle?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
            Regular servicing is recommended every 5,000–6,000 km or as stated in your
            motorcycle’s owner manual. Basic checks like chain lubrication and oil
            changes should be done more frequently.

            Touring motorcycles such as the BMW GS series, Honda Africa Twin,

    <details>
        <summary>Is ABS important on motorcycles?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
            Yes. ABS (Anti-lock Braking System) significantly improves safety by
            preventing wheel lock-up during sudden braking, especially on wet
            or slippery roads.

        <summary>What safety gear should every rider wear?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
            Essential motorcycle safety gear includes a certified helmet, gloves,
            riding jacket, riding pants, and proper boots. Protective gear reduces
            the risk of serious injuries in accidents.
